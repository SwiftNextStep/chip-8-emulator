**Did you ever wonder how video games work?**Â What goes inside that little box when you press the power button? How do that tiny silicon chips talk with each other to create the amazing graphics we see on the screen and respond to each press we make on the controllers?

If you want to not only have a complete understanding of how the _microprocessor talks to the memory, display, keyboard, and sound card_, but also what happens inside with all the registers, so that is the course for you.

**In this advanced course**, you will learn how to create your very own emulator for the _Chip-8_ in the **JavaScript** that runs in any browser, **so you can add it to your portfolio page and mesmerize job interviews with all your new knowledge.**

The Chip-8 is a virtual machine from the mid-1970s designed to make game development easier. There are a number of classic video games ported to CHIP-8, such as _Pong, Space Invaders, Tetris, and Pac-Man_. There are also applications like a _random maze generator and Conway's Game of Life_.

This course is ideal for anyone who has programming experience and always **dreamed of creating their own emulator** one day, or would love to create an emulator but just does not know where to start. Even someone who has attempted to create an emulator in the past and fail can greatly benefit from this course.

In this course, we will create new **classes in JavaScript for each piece of hardware**, t*o emulate the memory, the display, the sound card, and the keyboard*, after that, we will jump into the so expect Chip-8, we will first implement its registers and then we will implement each of its 35 opcodes

**After you complete this course you will have a fully functioning Chip-8 emulator that is capable to run hundreds of rooms available freely on the internet.**
